/* Olson2POSIX by GuruSR (https://www.github.com/GuruSR/Olson2POSIX)
 * Version 1.0, January   2, 2022
 * Version 1.1, January  12, 2022 - Fix issues with TZ strings with quoted <+-nn> names
 * Version 1.2, March    28, 2023 - Converted to a threaded system for main thread performance.
 * Version 1.3, January  12, 2024 - Added WebError and methods to get the last HTTP error.
 * Version 1.4, July     17, 2024 - Migrated away from getString to improve task performance.
 * Version 1.5, December  5, 2024 - Migrated from Arduino_JSON to ArduinoJson.
 * Version 1.6, April     6, 2025 - Fix mistake on WiFi pointer usage.
 *
 * This library offers the ability to convert from Olson to POSIX timezones as well as it will store the
 * Olson and POSIX in RTC memory to survive Deep Sleep.
 *
 * This library is adapted to work with the Arduino ESP32 and any other project that has similar libraries.
